  `The Uzbekistan Art and Culture Development Foundation (ACDF) preserves, promotes and nurtures Uzbekistan's heritage, arts and culture. Positioned at the forefront of Uzbekistan's cultural development, ACDF is committed to fostering the cultural ecosystem of the country, driving the creative economy, and providing opportunities for practitioners on a local, regional and global stage. ACDF believes that culture and heritage are vital in shaping society, uniting communities, bridging generations, and facilitating cross-cultural conversations.`,
  `ACDF has successfully led the fourth edition of the World Conference on Creative Economy (WCCE) (2-4 October 2024) in Tashkent and the inaugural Aral Culture Summit (4-6 April 2025) in Nukus, Karakalpakstan. The Foundation currently spearheads Uzbekistan's participation in Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, Japan (April – October 2025), the revitalisation of the Centre for Contemporary Arts in Tashkent, the construction of the new National Museum of Uzbekistan designed by Tadao Ando, and the restoration and partial reconstruction of the Palace of the Grand Duke of Romanov. ACDF has also launched "Tashkent Modernism XX/XXI", an ongoing research project documenting and protecting the city's modernist architecture, highlighted by two significant publications in collaboration with Rizzoli New York (published in November 2024) and Lars Müller Publishers (published in May 2025). In Bukhara, ACDF is launching the first Bukhara Biennial in September 2025.  In Samarkand, ACDF will host the forthcoming 43rd session of the UNESCO General Conference (30 October - 13 November 2025).`,
  `To date, ACDF has reached over 3.5 million visitors through landmark exhibitions across 17 countries: from the Louvre and Arab World Institute in Paris to the Uffizi in Florence, the British Museum in London, and the Palace Museum in Beijing. With projects presented across Europe, Asia, and the Gulf, and collaborations with over 40 international museums and cultural institutions, the Foundation is amplifying Uzbek voices and stories in the world's most influential cultural arenas.`,
